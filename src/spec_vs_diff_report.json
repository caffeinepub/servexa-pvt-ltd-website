  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements from the BuildRequest. TanStack Router configuration was added for /admin route (REQ-1), AdminDashboard component displays booking table with all required columns (REQ-2), status toggle functionality was implemented via dropdown menu and backend methods (REQ-3), and comprehensive error handling with loading states and error messages was added (REQ-4). No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
