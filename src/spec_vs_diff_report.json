  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements for Internet Identity authentication. REQ-1 (provider wrapping) is partially addressed but main.tsx shows InternetIdentityProvider is used without showing the wrap around App. REQ-2, REQ-4, REQ-5 are fully implemented via ProtectedRoute, LoginPage, and Header components. REQ-3 is preserved (home page remains public). REQ-6 (backend configuration) has no evidence in the diff. REQ-7 is satisfied by the implementation allowing any authenticated user.",

      "reason": "main.tsx shows InternetIdentityProvider exists but the diff does not show it wrapping the App component. The acceptance criteria requires the provider to wrap the application, but only the usage context is visible, not the actual wrapping implementation.",
